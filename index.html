                Whale hi there! 
            <p>
                I picked up that greeting from a college Christian fellowship called "AAIV". It stands for Asian American Intervarsity, and being a part of that community truly shaped me to be the person I am today. I met long-time friends through worship and small group gatherings, lead and mentored underclassmen, and even got baptized! My college years definitely solidified the foundation of my faith and encouraged me to continue to pour into the next generation.

                Why am I learning to code? Great question. If I'm being honest, it's to increase my financial prospectives. However, after working for a couple of years now, I also realized how much I love technology. The challenge of constantly learning and creating new and innovative tools has always motivated me. I'm a huge math nerd, so I love to solve problems and work with logic and numbers.
